# Fibonacci numbers
This is going to try showing Fibonacci numbers in an intuitive way.

This is one of my first projects I did when I started studying. I have now updated it a bit. 



## Some "funny" text and information

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.


All hail Leonardo Fibonacci, our lord and saviour. He was considered to be the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages.

Fibonacci himself was born in 1170 in Pisa and died 1250. 


## Happy Hacktober

I usually comes back to this project during hacktober just to have some fun updating it with things i learnt.
